## Introduction

Tbd.

> Freshwater is the most important resource for mankind, cross-cutting all social, economic and environmental activities. It is a condition for all life on our planet, an enabling limiting factor for any social and technological development, a possible source of welfare or misery, cooperation or conflict. (Unesco)

## Virtual Environement

To setup your local environemnt it is recommended to create a virtual environment using condas. Make sure you have it installed on your computer and then execute the command below:

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

The `environment.yml` file ensures that all dependiences will be downloaded.

After the enviroment is created, it is necessary to activate the virtual environemnt as follows:

```conda activate deep-water```

The virtual environment can be deactivate in a single line of code.

```conda deactivate```
